# EveryField
Delineating agricultural field boundaries from Sentinel-2 imagery. 

Code from Jesse Bakker's MA thesis project, University of Minnesota Department of Geography, Environment and Society.

Functions and descriptions are in the fields_functions.py and parameters are saved in the global_config.py file.

Fields Code Processing Demo walks through the processing steps. You will need to point the 'prep_file_dir' parameter in the global_config dictionary to a local directory with zipped .SAFE files from Sentinel-2.
